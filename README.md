# Classic-Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Classification-Techniques
Classify and assign patients to either a "Benign" or "Malignant" groups.

# Objective:

1. The breast cancer diagnostic problems are basically in the scope of the widely discussed classification problems.
2. The applied  prediction techniques assign patients to either a ”benign” group that is non- cancerous or a ”malignant” group that is cancerous.
3. The aim of the classification is to build a classifier based on some cases with some attributes to describe the objects or one attribute to describe the group of the objects. Then, the classifier is used to predict the group attributes of new cases from the domain based on the values of other attributes.

# Workflow:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Classification:
    - a.	Data Modelling.
    - b.	Division of dataset into: Train, Test and Validation set.
    - c.	Feature Scaling
    - d.  Training the **Logistic,SVM,Naive Bayes,KNN,Decision Tree,Random Forest** classification models on the training set.
    - e.  Confusion Matrix
    - f.	Model Evaluation on the Test data using the metrics R^2.
3. Model Selection.

# Conclusion:

1. Logistic Regression Classifier - 94.7% accuracy.
2. Support Vector Machine - 95.3% accuracy.
3. Naive Bayes Classifier - 94.1% accuracy .
4. K Nearest Neighbor Classifier - 94.7% accuracy.
5. Decision Tree Classifier  - 95.9% accuracy.
6. Randiom Forest Classifier - 93.5% accuracy.

The Best Model to Classify Breast Cancer is therefore **Decision Tree classification Model with 95.9% accuracy**.
